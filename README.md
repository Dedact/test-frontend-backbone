#Frontend BackboneJS Test - Tree structure of subjects

In [subjects.csv](subjects.csv) you will find a list of subjects that are part of our History learning method (_Leswijs Geschiedenis_). These subjects have a hierarchical structure: subjects can have _sub_-subjects that are more detailed. F.e.:

- Tijd van jagers en boeren
  - De eerste mensen
    - Evolutietheorie
    - Het scheppingsverhaal
    - Homo sapiens
  - Egyptenaren
    - De cultuur van de Egyptenaren
    - ...
- ...

All sources, tasks and questions available in Learnbeat have one or more subjects attached. That makes searching for learning material easy. 

## Test

Use [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) and its _events_, _models_ and _collections_ to create an interactive tree to select one or more subjects, so that it can be used by teachers to find learning material with those subjects.

## Assessment

* user interaction / user experience
